<h1>Notes</h1>
This is a randomizer for the English version of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King for the Nintendo 3DS. This program will create a patch for the game that randomizes the locations of monsters, treasures, etc.
<h1>Using the application</h1>
After opening the application, input your specifications and click "Randomize!". This will create several files in the "output" folder. Make sure to move or rename the folder before randomizing again, or it will be overwritten.
<h1>Applying the generated patches</h1>
Once the "output" folder has been created, within it you should see two folders: "romfs" and "spoiler". The "romfs" file contains all the patch data for your game.
<h2>If using a 3DS with Luma:</h2>
1. Copy the "romfs" folder to "luma/titles/000400000018F100" on your 3DS's SD card.
2. Turn on the 3DS while holding SELECT to open the Luma 3DS menu, and make sure that "Enable game patching" is enabled.
3. Open the game, and the changes should be applied.
<h2>If using Citra:</h2>
1. Right-click the game in Citra's menu and select "Open Mods Location".
2. Copy the "romfs" folder to the location that opens.
3. Launch the game, and the changes should be applied.
<h1>The Spoiler Log</h1>
The "spoiler" folder contains information about the randomized data. If you want the contents of the randomized patch to be a surprise, don't open this.
